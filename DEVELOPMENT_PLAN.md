# Secura Development Plan

## Project Overview
Secura is a middleware solution that acts as a secure gateway between client applications and large language models (LLMs). It enables organizations in regulated industries to safely utilize LLMs while ensuring data privacy, regulatory compliance, and maintaining comprehensive audit trails.

## MVP Objectives

### Core MVP Functionality
1. **Secure API Gateway**
   - Create a REST API that intercepts client requests intended for LLM providers
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Forward anonymized prompts to LLM providers and return responses to clients

2. **Data Anonymization Engine**
   - Develop NLP-based anonymization to detect and mask PII in prompts
   - Focus on standard PII detection (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses)
   - Support for healthcare-specific identifiers (initial vertical focus)

3. **Immutable Audit Trail**
   - Implement basic blockchain-based logging of request/response metadata
   - Store cryptographic hashes of interactions, not actual data
   - Provide a simple API to verify transaction integrity

4. **Basic Admin Dashboard**
   - Create a minimal web interface for viewing audit logs
   - Display anonymized prompts/responses
   - Implement basic search and filtering

### MVP Scope Limitations
- Initially support OpenAI API only (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Focus on text-based prompts (no images, audio)
- Target healthcare vertical for initial compliance features
- Simplified consent management (pre-registered client authentication only)
- Use a test/private blockchain for audit trails

## Branching Strategy & Version Control

### Git Workflow
We'll use a simplified Git Flow workflow:

- `main`: Production-ready code (protected branch)
- `develop`: Integration branch for features (protected branch)
- `feature/*`: New features and functionality
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

### Commit Message Convention
We'll follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(anonymization): implement regex-based PII detection

- Added support for names, emails, and phone numbers
- Created unit tests for each pattern
- Fixed issue with false positives on common words

Resolves: #123
```

### Versioning
We'll use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
