# Secura - Secure AI Gateway for Regulated Industries

Secura is a middleware solution that acts as a secure gateway between client applications and large language models (LLMs). It enables organizations in regulated industries to safely utilize LLMs while ensuring data privacy, regulatory compliance, and maintaining comprehensive audit trails.

## Key Features

- **Data Privacy**: Automatically anonymizes sensitive information before it's sent to LLM providers
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Blockchain-based logging of all AI interactions for tamper-proof compliance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built with GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations in mind
- **Consent Management**: Track and verify user consent for data processing
- **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor AI usage, view audit logs, and demonstrate compliance

## Architecture Overview

Secura consists of several key components:

- **API Gateway**: Central component handling authentication, routing, and LLM integration
- **Anonymization Service**: NLP-based service for detecting and masking PII
- **Blockchain Integration**: For immutable audit trails and consent verification
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and compliance verification
